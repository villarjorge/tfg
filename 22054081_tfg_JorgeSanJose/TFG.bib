	abstract = {This well-known undergraduate electrodynamics textbook is now available in a more affordable printing from Cambridge University Press. The Fourth Edition provides a rigorous, yet clear and accessible treatment of the fundamentals of electromagnetic theory and offers a sound platform for explorations of related applications ({AC} circuits, antennas, transmission lines, plasmas, optics and more). Written keeping in mind the conceptual hurdles typically faced by undergraduate students, this textbook illustrates the theoretical steps with well-chosen examples and careful illustrations. It balances text and equations, allowing the physics to shine through without compromising the rigour of the math, and includes numerous problems, varying from straightforward to elaborate, so that students can be assigned some problems to build their confidence and others to stretch their minds. A Solutions Manual is available to instructors teaching from the book; access can be requested from the resources section at www.cambridge.org/electrodynamics.},

	shorttitle = {Computational Physics},
	abstract = {The use of computation and simulation has become an essential part of the scientific process. Being able to transform a theory into an algorithm requires significant theoretical insight, detailed physical and mathematical understanding, and a working level of competency in programming. This upper-division text provides an unusually broad survey of the topics of modern computational physics from a multidisciplinary, computational science point of view. Its philosophy is rooted in learning by doing (assisted by many model programs), with new scientific materials as well as with the Python programming language. Python has become very popular, particularly for physics education and large scientific projects. It is probably the easiest programming language to learn for beginners, yet is also used for mainstream scientific computing, and has packages for excellent graphics and even symbolic manipulations. The text is designed for an upper-level undergraduate or beginning graduate course and provides the reader with the essential knowledge to understand computational tools and mathematical methods well enough to be successful. As part of the teaching of using computers to solve scientific problems, the reader is encouraged to work through a sample problem stated at the beginning of each chapter or unit, which involves studying the text, writing, debugging and running programs, visualizing the results, and the expressing in words what has been done and what can be concluded. Then there are exercises and problems at the end of each chapter for the reader to work on their own (with model programs given for that purpose). The text could be used for a one-semester course on scientific computing. The relevant topics for that are covered in the first third of the book. The latter two-thirds of the text includes more physics and can be used for a two-semester course in computational physics, covering nonlinear {ODEs}, Chaotic Scattering, Fourier Analysis, Wavelet Analysis, Nonlinear Maps, Chaotic systems, Fractals and Parallel Computing. The e-book extends the paper version by including many codes, visualizations and applets, as well as links to video lectures. * A table at the beginning of each chapter indicates video lectures, slides, applets and animations. * Applets illustrate the results to be expected for projects in the book, and to help understand some abstract concepts (e.g. Chaotic Scattering) * The {eBook}'s figures, equations, sections, chapters, index, table of contents, code listings, glossary, animations and executable codes (both Applets and Python programs) are linked, much like in a Web document. * Some equations are linked to their xml forms (which can be imported into Maple or Mathematica for manipulation). * The e-book will link to video-based lecture modules, held by principal author Professor Rubin Landau, that cover most every topic in the book},

	abstract = {This research used Huygens-Fresnel wave optics computer simulations to investigate the effects of high turbulence strength and inner scale on the normalized irradiance variance and coherence length of electromagnetic waves propagating through a turbulent atmosphere. These investigations developed several guidelines for validity of propagation simulations employing a numerical, split-step, Huygens-Fresnel, method, and within these guidelines, considered five types of turbulence spectrum inner scale: (1) zero inner scale, (2) Gaussian inner scale, (3) Hill's and (4) Frehlich's viscous-convective enhancement inner scales, and (5) turbulence spectrum truncation from the discrete grid representation. The simulation results showed that the normalized irradiance variance generally decreased (-30\%) below the zero inner scale values in the Rytov regime with increasing inner scale size, but increased monotonically in the saturation regime, and agreed within 2\% of the Rytov- Tatarski predictions at low turbulence strengths. The E-field coherence length in a spatially confined beam, with either spherical or plane wave divergence and zero inner scale, followed the Rytov-Tatarski-Fried predictions in the Rytov regime, but departed from the theory in the saturation regime. Increasing inner scale size modified this finite beam behavior by raising the coherence length (up to -50\%) in the saturation regime. {NA} {NA} U.S. Navy (U.S.N.) author. http://archive.org/details/computersimulati1094530843},

	title = {Optimizations on Designing High-Resolution Finite-Difference Schemes},
	abstract = {We describe a general optimization procedure for both maximizing the resolution characteristics of existing finite differencing schemes as well as designing finite difference schemes that will meet the error tolerance requirements of numerical solutions. The procedure is based on an optimization process. This is a generalization of the compact scheme introduced by Lele in which the resolution is improved for single, one-dimensional spatial derivative, whereas in the present approach the complete scheme, after spatial and temporal discretizations, is optimized on a range of parameters of the scheme and the governing equations. The approach is to linearize and Fourier analyze the discretized equations to check the resolving power of the scheme for various wave number ranges in the solution and optimize the resolution to satisfy the requirements of the problem. This represents a constrained nonlinear optimization problem which can be solved to obtain the nodal weights of discretization. An objective function is defined in the parametric space of wave numbers, Courant number, Mach number and other quantities of interest. Typical criterion for defining the objective function include the maximization of the resolution of high wave numbers for acoustic and electromagnetic wave propagations and turbulence calculations. The procedure is being tested on off-design conditions of non-uniform mesh, non-periodic boundary conditions, and non-constant wave speeds for scalar and system of equations. This includes the solution of wave equations and Euler equations using a conventional scheme with and without optimization and the design of an optimum scheme for the specified error tolerance.},

	title = {Modélisation numérique d’actionneurs plasma pour le contrôle d’écoulement},
	url = {https://hal.science/tel-01115653/},
	abstract = {As aerodynamic flow control still remains one of the top subjects of research in the aerospace scientific world, new ways to perform such a control are being constantly studied. Microwave plasma discharges have been proposed as a mean of a non-intrusive flow control method based on the creation of hot spots of air (via the creation of plasma discharges) which can eventually interact with the external flow and modify its attributes in a beneficial way to the aerodynamic coefficients of the body of interest. Moreover, other types of plasma actuators, based on the momentum addition in the flow instead of heat, have been proven capable of positively modifying the flow aerodynamic features. Nevertheless, the development and optimization of such actuators, require further understanding of the basic multi-scale physics involved. Experiments can provide such information, but they turn to be costly and incapable of capturing the complex interactions in small space and time scales. In this thesis, we are interested in the numerical modeling of plasma flow control actuators, in order to understand deeper their nature and applicability. Firstly, we present the theory behind aerodynamic flow control and plasma physics along with a literature review of the plasma actuators’ physics, applicability and effects. Then, numerical simulations performed using adapted techniques for each different actuator, reveal interesting features of their physics and complex nature, on the way to a deeper understanding and possible optimization of their performance in aerodynamic flow control applications. Three types of plasma actuators are considered: Microwave Plasma Discharges ({MPD}), the Dielectric Barrier Discharge ({DBD}) and the Plasma Synthetic Jet ({PSJ}). Concerning microwave discharges, the objectives are more fundamental than the other types of actuators. Numerical simulations can provide the basic information on the physics and complex interaction between the {EM} waves the plasma and the gas, in order to understand the plasma creation, evolution and energy balance. Flow control applications of such discharges, as an energy deposition method, have been already quite well documented in the literature. In order to reduce the computational cost, a novel implicit coupling of the Maxwell equations with the momentum transfer equation for electrons has been developed which with the addition of a simplified model of plasma-fluid equations have enabled three-dimensional simulations in time domain. The microwave breakdown and evolution of the plasma due to the electromagnetic waves has been studied numerically, in order to quantify the energy absorbed by the plasma and transferred to neutral molecules as gas heating. Coupling of the {EM}-plasma model with an Euler based solver accounting for real gas effects, have revealed interesting features of the complex interaction between the plasma itself and the pressure shock waves formed due to the intense gas heating during the plasma breakdown and evolution. Concerning the two other groups of actuators, the goals of this thesis is more applied as we are interested mostly on modeling their operation and consequent momentum production. For the {PSJ} actuator, the numerical solver consists of three coupled numerical models: One describing the plasma formation between both electrodes in an axisymmetrical configuration, one describing the electrical supply by an external generator, and a last one that focuses on the air’s heating in the cylindrical cavity where the plasma is formed, and the actual operation of the actuator. It uses the energy distribution computed by the first sub-model as source term and calculates the jet’s flow mass rate, momentum and energy, exiting the cavity at high speeds. An external {CFD} solver is used to integrate the calculated momentum source term into a global model of a flat plate flow, taking into account turbulent effects. Lastly, the {DBD} actuator model, developed in {DTIM}/{ONERA}, Toulouse, consists of solving the momentum equations for a set of simplified species and the Poisson’s equation. The calculated body force produced by the {DBD} actuator is being compared with experimental results and the induced wall-jet flow due to this force is modeled in a {CFD} solver. A similar model developed in {LAPLACE}/{UPS} has been used to perform parametric studies on the influence of turbulence - studying different turbulent models in a {RANS} approach - as well as more applied simulations for flow control purposes, including laminar-turbulent transition over a flat plate and lift coefficient modification on an airfoil due to a leading edge {DBD} actuator. These studies offer new perspectives in the understanding and the optimization of plasma actuators for flow control purposes.},

Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ({JAXA})({ISAS})), Sagamihara, Kanagawa Japan A two-dimensional finite-difference time domain ({FDTD}) code and two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) code were developed for examining shock waves driven by microwave-induced filamentary plasma. A unified code was then developed based on the two codes in order to investigate the relation between the ionization front and generated thrust in detail. In the analysis with the unified code, the shock wave formation is affected by the ionization structure. In the atmospheric pressure, the ionization front is discretely created and supports a strong shock wave. However, the energy absorption rate decreases in a diffusive ionization front which is obtained at the low ambient pressure since the diffusive region is difficult to efficiently absorb the microwave energy due to lower degree of ionization. 形態: カラー図版あり 形態: {PDF} Physical characteristics: Original contains color illustrations Physical characteristics: {PDF} 資料番号: {AA}0061856121 レポート番号: {STEP}-2012-038},

	abstract = {The propagation of {EM} radiation past wavelength-sized inhomogeneities is not well understood, yet is of importance for both microwave heating and diagnostic applications in tokamaks. The work presented in this thesis improves this understanding; for this purpose, {EMIT}-3D, a new finite-difference time-domain ({FDTD}) code implementing a cold-plasma model has been written to extend full-wave simulations of propagation in magnetized plasmas to 3D. The numerical development of the algorithm is presented and supported with a new stability analysis. Studies of propagation past density filaments (`blobs') are presented and compared with 2D simulations. The synergistic effects of blob density and width on scattering angle are investigated, resulting in the conclusion that even filaments of densities below beam critical density can cause significant deviation in beam paths over a wide frequency range. Further to this, the case of oblique incidence is an explicitly 3D interaction, and its effects have been calculated. The broadening and defocusing effect on microwave beams caused by realistic edge turbulence, observed in all magnetic fusion devices, is also investigated. A fluid model for edge turbulence is used to produce realistic turbulent profiles, which in turn are used to initialise a set of microwave propagation simulations. The effect of propagation through a turbulent layer is observed even at low fluctuation amplitude, and observed to have a peak when eddy sizes approach beam wavelength. This work supports {MAST} experiments using the {SAMI} diagnostic to image microwave emission from the plasma edge due to mode conversion from electron Bernstein waves; however, it has relevance for numerous microwave diagnostic, heating and current drive applications in plasmas.},

	abstract = {Numerical simulation dealing with acoustic phenomenology requieres different methods to approximate the value of characteristic and geometric properties of the environment where these phenomena occurs. Have been developed a collection of methods appropriate for different applications and use cases. Acoustic phenomena in underwater acoustics within closed environments are addressed. The use of fluid dynamics in specific regimes greatly simplify the number of variables involved in these environments allowing its characterisation. Furthermore, these closed environments are of special interest in the study of marine fauna, because marine mammals communication is based on the use of sound. Thus, it is of interest for the study of species in captivity in ponds, pools or in the wild. So it could be helpful since working with animals becomes complicated and expensive when it is intended to maintain their welfare. For this reason, this {TFG} presents an {API} that facilitates the development of acoustic simulation programs, based on accoustic propagation in time domain in closed spaces, allowing the study of their acoustic properties. Some programs have been developed using the {API} in the course of this work. The wave propagation algorithm is based on {FDTD}, with application for different boundary conditions, being useful for the accoustic property studies, by the use of the impulsive response.},

	abstract = {This paper reports a comprehensive set of hot-wire measurements of a round buoyant plume which was generated by forcing a jet of hot air vertically up into quiescent environment. The boundary conditions of the experiment were measured, and are documented in the present paper in an attempt to sort out the contradictory mean flow results from the earlier studies. The ambient temperature was monitored to insure that the facility was not stratified and that the experiment was conducted in a neutral environment. The axisymmetry of the flow was checked by using a planer array of sixteen thermocouples and the mean temperature measurements from these are used to supplement the hot-wire measurements. The source flow conditions were measured so as to ascertain the rate at which the buoyancy was added to the flow. The measurements conserve buoyancy within 10\%. The results are used to carry out the balances of the mean energy and momentum differential equations. In the mean energy equation it is found that the vertical advection of the energy'is primarily balanced by the radial turbulent transport. In the mean momentum equation the vertical advection of momentum and the buoyancy force balance the radial turbulent transport. The buoyancy force is the second largest term in this balance and is responsible for the wider (and higher) velocity profiles in plumes as compared to jets. Budgets of the temperature variance and turbulence kinetic energy are also carried out in which thermal and mechanical dissipation rates are obtained as the closing terms. Similarities and differences between the two balances are discussed. It is found that even though the direct affect of buoyancy on turbulence, as evidenced by the buoyancy production term, is substantial, most of the turbulence is produced by shear. This is in contrast to the mean velocity field where the affect of buoyancy force is quite strong. Therefore, it is concluded that in a buoyant plume the primary affect of buoyancy on turbulence is indirect, and enters through the mean velocity field (giving larger shear production).},

As an example, the transient temperature field was calculated in biological tissue in response to a pulse of focused ultrasound. Enhanced heating of the tissue from finite-amplitude effects was observed. The excess heating was attributed to the nonlinear generation of higher-frequency harmonics which are absorbed more readily than the fundamental.

In this report a method for coupling random refractivity fluctuations into {TEMPER} is proposed and tested numerically. Three-dimensional spectral models from the atmospheric literature are used to derive the one-dimensional transverse spectra of refractivity necessary for parabolic simulations. Realizations consistent with the spectra are generated using filtered white noise. Propagation studies are conducted for the canonical problem of a plane wave transmitted through homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Good agreement is observed between the numerical results and existing theory for the second moment of the scattered field. However, the agreement is less good for predicting the random fluctuations in the log-amplitude of the field as three-dimensional effects become significant. Methods for simulating inhomogeneous boundary layer turbulence are considered. The limits of spectral modeling for simulating turbulence are discussed.},

	abstract = {The global underwater acoustic surveillance network known as the Sound Surveillance System ({SOSUS}) allowed the {US} to identify Soviet submarines during the Cold War, and its history holds important lessons for the present. Submarines conducting military operations in the world's oceans are now the most active since the end of the Cold War. As undersea competition intensifies in the Indo-Pacific among the {US}, China, and Russia, acoustic surveillance systems are again gaining relevance. In addition, technological developments such as Unmanned Underwater Vehicles ({UUVs}) have the potential to change military strategies dramatically. This article describes the ways that countries are responding to new challenges in the maritime domain. It argues that the experience of the Cold War shows that collaboration across industry, academia, and government, as well as cooperation among the {US} and its allies and partners, will be essential to tackling today’s rapidly changing strategic undersea environment.},

	abstract = {The resolution of astronomical imaging from large optical telescopes is usually limited by the blurring effects of refractive index fluctuations in the Earth’s atmosphere. By taking a large number of short exposure images through the atmosphere, and then selecting, re-centring and co-adding the best images this resolution limit can be overcome. This approach has significant benefits over other techniques for high-resolution optical imaging from the ground. In particular the reference stars used for our method (the Lucky Exposures technique) can generally be fainter than those required for the natural guide star adaptive optics approach or those required for other speckle imaging techniques. The low complexity and low instrumentation costs associated with the Lucky Exposures method make it appealing for medium-sized astronomical observatories. The method can provide essentially diffraction-limited I-band imaging from well-figured ground-based telescopes as large as 2.5 m diameter. The faint limiting magnitude and large isoplanatic patch size for the Lucky Exposures technique at the Nordic Optical Telescope means that 25\% of the night sky is within range of a suitable reference star for I-band imaging. Typically the 1\%—10\% of exposures with the highest Strehl ratios are selected. When these exposures are shifted and added together, field stars in the resulting images have Strehl ratios as high as 0.26 and full width at half maximum flux ({FWHM}) as small as 90 milliarcseconds. Within the selected exposures the isoplanatic patch is found to be up to 60 arcseconds in diameter at 810 nm wavelength. Images within globular clusters and of multiple stars from the Nordic Optical Telescope using reference stars as faint as I 16 are presented. A new generation of {CCDs} (Marconi L3Vision {CCDs}) were used in these observations, allowing extremely low noise high frame-rate imaging with both fine pixel sampling and a relatively wide field of view. The theoretical performance of these {CCDs} is compared with the experimental results obtained.},
